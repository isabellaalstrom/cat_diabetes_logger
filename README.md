# 🐱 Cat Diabetes Logger for Senvelgo

A Home Assistant add-on for logging and monitoring diabetes treatment with Senvelgo for cats.

## 📋 Description

Cat Diabetes Logger is a web application specifically designed to log and track a cat’s diabetes treatment with Senvelgo (not insulin). The application makes it easy to record medication, measurements, and general condition, and it automatically generates daily summaries.  
The application is developed for personal use, however I might take PRs. Language is only Swedish right now.
